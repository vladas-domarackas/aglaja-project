               Piercing gets nasty, hurts or something is oozing out of it?
           </h2>
            <p class="text-header">It happened. Area of the piercing the piercing swelled? It's warm and tender? Or maybe something started growing next to it? Unfortunately our bodies are quite moody. Most probably it's not your fault, there might be some genetic predispositions, a party or stressful time in your life and the piercing starts to react. What to do in this case?</p>
            <p class="text-header">Niestety w tym temacie także dużo jest mitów, które mogą niestety kosztować nawet utratę ciągłości tkanki. Wiele dziwnych rzeczy może stać się z przekłuciem, jak np. zakażenie, ziarnina, migracja. Nie warto tego bagatelizować, bo odbije się to na twoim zdrowiu.</p>
            <h3 class="problem">
              Swelling
            </h3>
            <p class="sub-text">Swelling is one of the most common piercing-related problems. If the swelling gets uncomfortable, follow the steps. Remember though, if the swelling happened quickly quite some time after making the piercing, it might be an infection.</p>
            <p class="list-title">Swelling of a skin piercing</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Make an infusion from two bags of medical sage/oak bark according to the instruction on a package.</li>
              <li>Put the infusion in a refrigerator and put soaked gauses on the piercing. Be sure they're cold/lukewarm.</li>
              <li>Use till it star to work.</li>
            </ol>
            <p class="list-title">Swelling in mouth cavity piercings.</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Make ice cubes from a sage/oak bark infusion. .</li>
              <li>Put it in your mouth and wait until it'll melt. DO NOT SUCK ON IT!</li>
            </ol>
            <h3 class="problem">
             Infection
           </h3>
            <p class="sub-text">Infections, as the name says, happens when microorganisms invade the wound. They usually are not dangerous, but they're annoying and they can happen even if you take perfect care of the piercing. What to do in case of it?</p>
            <p class="list-title">Infection of a skin piercing</p>
            <ol>
              <li>How to diagnose it? The place is red, there is a white, opaque and dense liquid, the area is warm and painful. Remember though that not every symptom has to appear, you will be 100% sure that it's an infection if there's pus. You can always contact me to differenciate an infection from an for example irritation. </li>
              <li>Don't take out your piercing!</li>
              <li>Apply the steps in section "Swelling of a skin piercing". You can also use coloidal silver.</li>
              <li>If that won't work, contact your piercer.</li>
              <li>If the piercer will say so, you can use octenisept and tribiotic. Do not overuse these supplies though, otherwise you will dry out the piercing canal or superinfection will happen, which is extremely hard to heal.</li>
            </ol>
            <p class="list-title">Infection in mouth cavity.</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Again: do not take out your ring!</li>
              <li>Rinse your mouth with octenidol, and apply the steps in section called "Swelling of mouth cavity piercing."</li>
            </ol>
            <h3 class="problem">
              Granuloma
            </h3>
            <p class="sub-text">Granuloma is a type of healing, especially prominent in case of places that are poorly supplied by blood. Unfortunately its s bit ugly, but you can easily get rid of it.</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Granuloma is a kind of a skin-colored, non-painful bump near the piercing. Remember: these rules apply for only healed piercings. If they're not healed yet, wait till they are.</li>
              <li>At first, try to dry it up by using salicylic alcohol 2/3 times a day.</li>
              <li>If that won't work, you can apply tea tree oil OR a mush made from saline and aspirine, apply 2/3 times a day.</li>
              <li>IMPORTANT: the mush has to be washed away after 15/20 minutes.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>
              Migration
            </h3>
            <p class="sub-text">Migration, quite rare, but impossible to heal - by that I mean that you won't be able to reverse that process, you can only stop it. In case of migration contact your piercer immediately.</p>
            <ol>
              <li>You will recognise migration by a change of the position of the piercing canal. If the skin on one side of a piercing is translucent, do not listen to the following instructions - take out your piercing, let it heal and pierce it again.</li>
              <li>If the piercing is healed, change the ring to a shorter one.</li>
              <li>Pay attention to whether you are irritating the piercing by for example wearing loose shirts. </li>
            </ol>
