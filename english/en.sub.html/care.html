                     How to properly take care of your piercing? 
                   </h2>
                   <p class="text-header">There are a lot of myths surrounding piercing care. How to avoid a piercing infection or a granuloma? Read on to find out. </p>
                   <p class="text-header">Let's start with one of the most popular myths: NO, YOUR PIERCING DID NOT HEAL IN A WEEK. Best case scenario, the irritation has gone down, but the inside is still vulnerable to bacteria and injury. If you don't follow these instructions, you're making problems more likely. It's also important not to soak piercings in water, especially in lakes, rivers or the sea. </p>
                   <h3>
                       Skin piercings
                   </h3>
                   <ol>
                       <li>buy colloidal silver and a saltwater spray and sterile, 5x5cm gauze compresses. </li>
                       <li>Soak the compress, or a cotton-tipped swab (be careful, as the strands of cotton can catch on the jewellery) in saltwater and clean the piercing 3 times a day. If you're using colloidal silver, do it once a day. Do not use octenisept (octenidine), alcohol or hydrogen peroxide! </li>
                       <li>Don't do this procedure on the day of the piercing - it's quite raw, irritated and sore, so you might easily lead to an infection. In the case of cartilage piercing, it's a good idea to leave the scab on for a few days, otherwise it might bleed often.</li>
                       <li>A travel pillow might come in handy if you get cartilage piercings and you are a side sleeper.</li>
                       <li>Do not be alarmed if the site of the piercing is oozing a transparent, yellowish fluid that dries into a crusty deposit around the jewellery - it's lymphatic fluid and it's completely normal when you have a fresh skin wound. If the fluid isn't transparent but white, yellow or green, doesn't dry and is sticky, that might be a sign of infection. In that case, find instructions <a href="../en.sub.html/infection.html">here</a>.</li>
                       <li>Don't drink alcohol on the day of the piercing - it will make you bleed more</li>
                   </ol>
                   <h3>
                      Mucus membrane piercings
                   </h3>
                      <p class="text-header">Whether you have an intimate piercing or a piercing in the mouth, the mucous membrane requires slightly different care than the skin. This doesn't apply to the nose - clean the inside of your nose just like the <strong>SKIN PIERCINGS</strong></p>
                   <ol>
                       <li>Do not be alarmed by swelling. Mucous membranes tend to swell, which may cause difficulty speaking for a little while. </li>
                       <li>If the swelling is large, it helps to freeze sage tea and then to put the sage ice cube in your mouth and let it dissolve. It's important not to suck on it though, as it might lead to irritation of the tissue. </li>
                       <li>If the piercing is in the mouth cavity, it's best to avoid smoking, alcohol, dairy and food that is spicy, hot or crunchy. </li>
                       <li>Rinse your mouth out 3 times a day with octenidol or a different, ALCOHOL-FREE antibacterial mouthwash.</li>
                       <li>Use children's toothpaste - it doesn't contain menthol, which may irritate the site of the piercing. It's also advisable to use a soft-bristled toothbrush.</li>
                   </ol>
                   <h3>
                      So what about surface-bars and microdermals?
                   </h3>
                       <p class="text-header">Even though there are some similarities, there are also some differences in terms of caring about the surface and microdermal piercings.</p>
                   <ol>
                       <li>Cleaning is similar to other skin piercings - clean around the piercing canal.</li>
                       <li>Important: when cleaning the microdermal piercing, apply pressure (by a finger and through a sterile gause) for 5 minutes. </li>
                       <li>Even more important: Your surface-bars won't migrate if you will not irritate the piercing. For example, if it's a cleavage piercing, don't wear backpacks or purses.</li>
                   </ol>
