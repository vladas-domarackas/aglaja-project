                  Ear piercings are the most popular type of piercings since the ancient times. Unfortunately because of that a lot of people are doing them unprofessionally (who didn't hear about the potato method?) which repeats fake infos. Of course in this (and every other) section i won't show all of the piercings, only the most popular ones.

                  <li>Get enough sleep, eat and hydrate - that's how the pain and stress will get lower.</li>
                  <li>Don't drink in the day of the appointment - alcohol dilutes the blood, so it will bleed more.</li>
                  <li>If the piercing is not on your face/ears, wear loose clothing (but not oversize, it'll irritate the piercing).</li>
                  <li>If the piercing is going to be more painful, you can buy band-aids with lidocaine.</li>
